    "***Key Concepts:*** *Experiment Tracking, MLflow, Weights & Biases*\n",
    "\n",
    "When training models, you often need to run hundreds of experiments with different types of models and different hyperparameters to find what works best. Keeping track of every experiment and how each design decision affected the model performance is hardly feasible without additional tools. That is why experiment trackers like [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site), or [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) are often one of the first touchpoints ML practitioners have with MLOps as they progress through the ML journey. In addition, these tools are invaluable for larger ML teams, as they allow them to share experiment results and collaborate during experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many excellent experiment tracking tools, we should aim to prevent vendor lock-in by writing modular ML code that allows us to switch between different tools easily. That is precisely what ZenML will do for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will focus on how to effectively track experiments with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), which is one of the most popular open-source MLOps tools and used by many ML teams in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For research-heavy ML teams, we have also included a short bonus section at the end on how to use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) instead of MLflow in your ZenML pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please run the following commands to install both tools with their respective dependencies. This will also restart the kernel of your notebook."
